# Expanded Lisp

This project is based on another I found. is a lisp implementation I discovered that was intending to act as an example of what a minimal lisp implementation should do.

I've decided to document it's behavior, and try and expand it.

The original can be found here: www.sonoma.edu/users/l/luvisi/sl3.c  
And an explanation for it here: https://wiki.c2.com/?ImplementingLisp

Current Changes:
Added several native functions:
    + >, <, <=, >=, !=
    + Documentation for object creation
